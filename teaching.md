## International Experience 

<strong style="font-size: 125%;"> D-tree International (Zanzibar, Tanzania) </strong>  
**Employee Research and Stata Training**  
_Course organizer and lead instructor, Summer 2017_  
I developed and taught an 8-week long statistical training course at the Zanzibar D-tree office. The trainees were D-tree International employees and their key partners at the Ministry of Health. The goal of the course was to equip trainees to identify and answer pressing research questions that arose from the Safer Deliveries program of which they are all involved in coordinating. The specific skills taught in this course were as follows: knowledge of statistical and epidemiological methods, analyzing data in Stata (software package), and presentation of results. The course ran for 8 weeks and was organized into weekly 3-hour training sessions that involved a short lecture and an activity. All of the lectures and activities were tailored to the Safer Deliveries program; throughout the course, the trainees worked in pairs on a specific research question. At the end of the training, the trainees presented their research results to the broader organization.
