<h1>Selected Experience</h1>

<strong style="font-size: 125%;"> D-tree International (Zanzibar, Tanzania) </strong>  
**Data Analysis and Stata Software Training Course**  
_Course organizer and lead instructor, Summer 2017_  
I developed and taught an 8-week long statistical training course at the Zanzibar D-tree office. The trainees were D-tree International employees and their key partners at the Ministry of Health. The goal of the course was to equip trainees with tools to identify and answer pressing research questions that arose from the <a href="http://www.d-tree.org/saving-lives/womens-lives/safer-deliveries/"> Safer Deliveries </a> program in which they were all involved. The specific skills taught in this course were as follows:  
* Understanding of common statistical and epidemiological methods  
* Analyzing data in Stata (statistical software package)  
* Presentation of results  
The course ran for 8 weeks and was organized into weekly 3-hour training sessions that involved a short lecture and an activity. All of the lectures and activities were geared towards the Safer Deliveries program; throughout the course, the trainees worked in pairs on a specific research question and applied the statistical and computing tools they acquired from the session. At the end of the training, the trainees presented their research results to the broader organization.

**ID201: Core Principles of Biostatistics and Epidemiology for Public Health Practice**  
_Head Teaching Assistant, Fall 2016 & Fall 2017_  
Currently, I am a head teaching assistant for an introductory biostatistics and epidemiology course of over 200 students and 16 teaching assistants. In the Fall of 2016, I developed extensive lab and homework materials for use during this course. I have continued to update this content in addition to holding weekly lab sessions, office hours, meeting with students, and managing administrative aspects of the course.

**Stata Orientation for Incoming Graduate Students**  
_Session Leader, Summer 2016 & Summer 2017_  
During orientation week at the school, new graduate students have the ability to attend a two-hour Stata training course. The goal of the course is to familiarize students with the Stata software, which is the primary software used in the introductory statistics courses at the school. Over the past two years, I have organized and led six of these sessions (one of which can be viewed <a href="https://mediasite.video.harvard.edu/Mediasite/Play/b3bd374f4b4845ad86c722c18254b39a1d"> here</a>).
