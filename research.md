## Causal mediation analysis 
A large portion of my dissertation work focuses on mediation analysis in the presence of unmeasured confounding or measurement error in the mediator. 

#### (1) Estimation of indirect causal effects of a confounded treatment  
We develop a novel causal effect known as the "population intervention indirect effect" (PIIE) that is identified in the presence of exposure-outcome confounding. We also derive semiparametric estimators for the PIIE.

#### (2) Robust inference on natural indirect effects  
+ **Collaborators:** Xu Shi and Eric Tchetgen Tchetgen 
+ **Overview:** This work shows that the natural indirect effect (NIE) is in fact identified in the presence of classical measurement error of the mediator and unmeasured confounding of both exposure-outcome and mediator-outcome relations under certain no interaction assumptions. We provide a new estimator for the NIE.

#### (3) Mediation analysis with censored survival data  
+ **Collaborators:** Paige Williams and Eric Tchetgen Tchetgen 
+ **Overview:** The well-known "difference" and "product" methods for estimation of the natural indirect effect may produce substantially different estimates in the presence of censoring or truncation, due to a form of model misspecification.

## Interference / network data

#### Estimation and inference of causal treatment effects on a network 
+ **Collaborators:** Ilya Shpitser and Eric Tchetgen Tchetgen 
+ **Overview:** The proposed method will allow one to estimate causal effects in vaccine trials for infectious diseases on a network of interconnected indiviudals, while acknowledging complex dependencies in the data. These methods can be applied in a variety of settings in the health and social sciences where network data are available
