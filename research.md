## Dissertation work  
<strong style="font-size: 120%;"> Causal inference methods development </strong>  
Harvard University (Cambridge, MA)  
_Supervised by: Dr. Eric Tchetgen Tchetgen_  

I am interested in developing statistical techniques that will enable scientists to infer causation about an intervention of interest in settings where the standard randomized experiment may be impractical, unethical, or insufficient such that observational studies or more complex experimental designs must be used. The current causal inference literature provides a framework for handling such situations, but the standard methods often require stringent assumptions, such as (1) no unmeasured confounding of the relationship of interest or (2) no spillover effects of the intervention given to one person on another person's outcome. The goal of my work is to develop new methods when each of these conditions are relaxed.  

<strong style="font-size: 100%;"> I. Estimation and inference of causal treatment effects on a network </strong>  
Currently, most methods on the estimation of causal effects in the presence of interference require the notion of partial interference. Partial interference is when study units are grouped into clusters and there is no interference between units in different clusters [24]. In many situations where interference may be present, it may not be reasonable to assume
partial interference when evaluating causal effects. This is in fact the case when individuals are connected in arbitrary patterns, so that the observed sample is essentially a single realization of a random network. However, there are currently no general statistical methods for evaluating causal effects on a network. We propose combining the
network literature with the causal inference framework in order to develop formal methods to evaluate direct and spillover causal effects on a network. In doing so, we will be able to account for interference among all individuals in a network, while acknowledging complex dependencies in the data. Our proposed methods will allow one to estimate causal effects
in vaccine trials for infectious diseases in which partial interference is unlikely to hold. Additionally, the methods can be applied in a variety of settings in the health and socials sciences where network data are available.  

<strong style="font-size: 100%;"> II. Estimation of indirect causal effects of a confounded treatment </strong>  
The population intervention effect (PIE) of an exposure measures the expected change of an outcome from its observed value, if one were to intervene to withhold the exposure in the entire population. This effect is of interest particularly in settings where one may wish to evaluate the impact of eliminating a harmful exposure from a population. The goal of this work is to develop methodology to identify and estimate the extent to which the exposure affects the outcome through an intermediate variable in a setting where the exposure-outcome relation may be subject to unmeasured confounding.  

Additionally, I have done <a href="http://journals.lww.com/epidem/Citation/2017/09000/Mediation_Analysis_for_Censored_Survival_Data.5.aspx"> work </a> on causal mediation analysis in a survival data setting.
