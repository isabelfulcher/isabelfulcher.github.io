<center> <strong style="font-size: 135%;"> Data-driven COVID-19 response </strong> </center> 
I am currently working in partnership with Partners in Health sites to utilize routine data for COVID-19 response in seven countries. The work spans conducting syndromic surveillance, assessing disruptions in health service utilization, and serosurveillance studies in various at-risk populations.

<center> <strong style="font-size: 135%;"> Causal inference methods </strong> </center>
My causal inference methods research currently falls in two areas: (1) causal mediation analysis and (2) estimating causal effects on a network of interconnected units. I am interested in developing methods that relax common assumptions in causal inference required for identification of causal effects. Causal queries often require stringent assumptions about the relationships between these variables that may not hold in the absence of a randomized trial.

I work with several organizations that aim to improve the delivery of sexual and reproductive health. The goal of my work is to support and grow research efforts through the use of causal inference and data science.
