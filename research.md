## Dissertation work  
<strong style="font-size: 120%;"> Causal inference methods development </strong>  
Harvard University (Cambridge, MA)  
_Supervised by: Dr. Eric Tchetgen Tchetgen_  

I am interested in developing statistical techniques that will enable scientists to infer causation about an intervention of interest in settings where the standard randomized experiment may be impractical, unethical, or insufficient such that observational studies or more complex experimental designs must be used. The current causal inference literature provides a framework for handling such situations, but the standard methods often require stringent assumptions, such as (1) no unmeasured confounding of the relationship of interest or (2) no spillover effects of the intervention given to one person on another person's outcome. The goal of my work is to develop new methods when each of these conditions are relaxed.  


<strong style="font-size: 100%;"> (1) Estimation of indirect causal effects of a confounded treatment </strong>  
The goal of this work is to develop methodology to identify and estimate the extent to which the exposure affects the outcome through an intermediate variable in a setting where the exposure-outcome relation may be subject to unmeasured confounding. This is known as the "population intervention indirect effect". I have developed a <a href="https://isabelfulcher.github.io/frontdoorpiie/"> R package</a> for application of the methods. Draft of paper coming soon.   

<strong style="font-size: 100%;"> (2) Estimation and inference of causal treatment effects on a network </strong>  
The proposed method will allow one to estimate causal effects in vaccine trials for infectious diseases on a network of interconnected indiviudals, while acknowledging complex dependencies in the data. These methods can be applied in a variety of settings in the health and socials sciences where network data are available. Draft of related <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.01577"> paper</a> is currently available. R package coming soon.  


Additionally, I have done <a href="http://journals.lww.com/epidem/Citation/2017/09000/Mediation_Analysis_for_Censored_Survival_Data.5.aspx"> work</a> on causal mediation analysis in a survival data setting.
