## Causal mediation analysis 
A large portion of my dissertation work focuses on mediation analysis in the presence of unmeasured confounding or measurement error in the mediator. 

#### (1) Estimation of indirect causal effects of a confounded treatment  
+ **Collaborators:** <a href="https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~ilyas/"> Ilya Shpitser </a> and Eric Tchetgen Tchetgen 
+ **Overview:** We develop a novel causal effect known as the "population intervention indirect effect" (PIIE) that is identified in the presence of exposure-outcome confounding. We also derive semiparametric estimators for the PIIE.
+ **Paper:** <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.03611">Robust inference on indirect causal effects</a> *(Under review)*
+ **Software:** <a href="https://isabelfulcher.github.io/frontdoorpiie/"> R package</a>
+ **Conferences:** [ENAR 2018 presentation](img/enar2018); [ACIC 2018 poster](img/acic2018)

<strong style="font-size: 100%;"> (2) Robust inference on natural indirect effects </strong>  
+ **Collaborators:** Xu Shi and Eric Tchetgen Tchetgen 
+ **Overview:** This work shows that the natural indirect effect (NIE) is in fact identified in the presence of classical measurement error of the mediator and unmeasured confounding of both exposure-outcome and mediator-outcome relations under certain no interaction assumptions. We provide a new estimator for the NIE.

<strong style="font-size: 100%;"> (3) Mediation analysis with censored survival data </strong>  
+ **Collaborators:** Paige Williams and Eric Tchetgen Tchetgen 
+ **Overview:** The well-known "difference" and "product" methods for estimation of the natural indirect effect may produce substantially different estimates in the presence of censoring or truncation, due to a form of model misspecification.

## Interference / Network data

<strong style="font-size: 100%;"> Estimation and inference of causal treatment effects on a network </strong>  
+ **Collaborators:** Ilya Shpitser and Eric Tchetgen Tchetgen 
+ **Overview:** The proposed method will allow one to estimate causal effects in vaccine trials for infectious diseases on a network of interconnected indiviudals, while acknowledging complex dependencies in the data. These methods can be applied in a variety of settings in the health and social sciences where network data are available
